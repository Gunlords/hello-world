# hello-world
My name is Ankur Chowdhury. I use he/him pronouns.
I'm originally from Bangladesh, but I've been living in the United States for the past five years. I’m majoring in computer science and will be graduating this semester. I'm passionate about cybersecurity, and I’ve been working on various hands-on projects in this field, including penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and building a Student-run Cybersecurity Service Center.
